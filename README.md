# Asteria

## User Story

GIVEN I am a space enthusiast who would like to know more about Martian rovers and the photos that they take.
I WANT an application that allows me to search a date and have images taken by a Mars rover populated onto my screen.
SO THAT I can have a greater undestanding of the surface of Mars and the process it takes to get a rover onto its surface.

## Usage

Asteria is a web application that utilizes NASA's Mars Rover API to populate stunning images from a user-selected date onto a modal for viewing and exploring. Up to 25 images can be populated for any given date, so select whichever day works for you since January 1st, 2010. As you scroll down the page you will see information regarding the Martian landscape, NASA's JPL and the rovers themselves. After this point, we will show the current weather for the area around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Base and will, based on NASA's own criteria, determine in real time if a space launch would be viable for that today or not. The "subscribe" section located in the footer is mostly non-functioning, with the exception that any user input would be stored into Local Storage. Your inbox is safe here.
