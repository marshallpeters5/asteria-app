              <p>
                Much like Earth, the landscape of Mars is characterized by a variety of features that have
                been shaped by geological processes over billions of years.
                Some of the most prominent features on Mars include impact
                craters (Mars holds 21% of the solar systems impact craters,
                second only to our moon at 31%), volcanoes such as Olympus
                Mons which is approximately 3x larger than Mount Everest and is visible from Earth's surface through a
                high-power telescopic lens. Other interesting landscape features including
                canyons, such as the Mariner Valley Canyon which is nearly
                2,600 miles long and 4x larger than the Grand Canyon, and vast
                plains spanning up to 3,400 km (2100~ mi) wide also run across the Red Planet.

              <p>
                NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally-funded research and development center located in
                Pasadena, California. JPL is primarily responsible for the development and operation of robotic
                spacecraft for many of NASA's space exploration missions, including those of which have the fruits of
                their labor on display here.
                JPL's primary mission is to conduct space exploration and Earth science research, and to design, build,
                and operate robotic spacecraft and planetary rovers. JPL has been responsible for many of NASA's most
                successful missions, including the Mars Exploration Rovers you see below, the Mars Reconnaissance
                Orbiter, the
                Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn, and the Voyager missions to the outer planets.
                In addition to designing and building spacecraft, JPL also conducts research on a variety of scientific
                topics, such as astrophysics, Earth science, and climate change. JPL is home to a number of specialized
                facilities, including a Deep Space Network for communicating with spacecraft, a Mars Yard for testing
                rovers, and a Clean Room for assembling and testing spacecraft components
                Needless to say, JPL plays a critical role in NASA's efforts to explore our solar system and to
                understand its vast environments.

          Perseverance Landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021; its
          mission was to help answer the question about signs of past
          microbial life on the Red Planet. It had a similar objective to
          Curiosity, it explored rocks, dirt, and air. It's the size of a
          small SUV. This rover looks for direct signs of past life on Mars.
          In addition, the Perseverance goal is to test the air in Mars's
          atmosphere and help Nasa discover methods of getting oxygen from the
          air in the Martian atmosphere. This would increase Nasa chances of
          designing items that would allow astronauts to explore Mars in the
          future.<br>

          According to NASA Spirit and Opportunity were twin rovers sent to
          planet Mars to determine whether water ever existed on the Red
          Planet. The Rovers landed on opposite regions of Mars; Spirit landed
          in a region called Gusev Crater and found evidence that water may
          have been once present on the planet millions of years ago. On the
          other hand, The Opportunity landed on Meridiani Planum. It studied
          layers of minerals in the rocks, and the evidence it collected
          suggested there may have been the presence of a salty sea on
          Mars.<br>

          Per NASA Curiosity was sent to Mars to determine if that planet
          had conditions to support microbial life. This rover is known to
          be the largest robot to ever land on another planet, it's the size
          of an SUV. Its big wheels help it roll over rocks and sand without
          the threat of being stuck. Curiosity landed in Gale Crater which
          also has a tall mountain in the middle of its existence. This
          mountain had many layers of rock and each layer had different
          minerals from a different time period which tells NASA about the
          possibility that the Red Planet had water at one point. <br>

                There are a many variables to consider before NASA's billion dollar tool can be safely launched on it's
                journey
                to Mars, and a lot
                of that relies on the weather. More information on specific launch criteria can be viewed <a

                  id="weather-source">here</a>. In the list below we will display today's weather forecast at the Cape
                Canaveral Air Force Base where the rovers
                are launched from so that we can see just how difficult it can be to
                achieve a successful take off. If any of these criteria fail the all-systems-go ready check,
                then any launches scheduled for the day would be postponed. However, if all of the weather checks come
                back green,
                then the mission would proceed as planned.
