              <p>
                The landscape of Mars is characterized by a variety of features that have
                been shaped by geological processes over billions of years.
                Some of the most prominent features on Mars include impact
                craters (Mars holds 21% of the solar systems impact craters,
                second only to our moon at 31%), volcanoes such as Olympus
                Mons which is approximately 3x larger than Mount Everest and is visible from Earth's surface through a
                high-powered telescopic lens,
                canyons such as the Mariner Valley Canyon which is nearly
                2,600 miles long and 4x larger than the Grand Canyon, and vast
                plains spanning up to 3,400 km (2100~ mi) wide.

                In the 1930's the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was the
                birthplace of rocket propulsion. In the context of space
                exploration, a "landing" generally refers to the process of
                safely bringing a spacecraft down to the surface of a planet
                or other celestial body. NASA's JPL (Jet Propulsion Lab) has
                been involved in the development and operation of a number of
                such lander missions, including the Mars Pathfinder mission in
                1996, the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) in
                2004, the Mars Phoenix lander in 2008, and the Mars Science
                Laboratory (Curiosity rover) in 2012. NASA's JPL is also
                currently involved in the development of the Mars 2020
                mission, which includes the Perseverance rover and the
                Ingenuity Mars helicopter.

          Perseverance Landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021; its
          mission was to help answer the question about signs of past
          microbial life on the Red Planet. It had a similar objective to
          Curiosity, it explored rocks, dirt, and air. It's the size of a
          small SUV. This rover looks for direct signs of past life on Mars.
          In addition, the Perseverance goal is to test the air in Mars's
          atmosphere and help Nasa discover methods of getting oxygen from the
          air in the Martian atmosphere. This would increase Nasa chances of
          designing items that would allow astronauts to explore Mars in the
          future.<br>

          According to NASA Spirit and Opportunity were twin rovers sent to
          planet Mars to determine whether water ever existed on the Red
          Planet. The Rovers landed on opposite regions of Mars; Spirit landed
          in a region called Gusev Crater and found evidence that water may
          have been once present on the planet millions of years ago. On the
          other hand, The Opportunity landed on Meridiani Planum. It studied
          layers of minerals in the rocks, and the evidence it collected
          suggested there may have been the presence of a salty sea on
          Mars.<br>

            Per NASA Curiosity was sent to Mars to determine if that planet
            had conditions to support microbial life. This rover is known to
            be the largest robot to ever land on another planet, it's the size
            of an SUV. Its big wheels help it roll over rocks and sand without
            the threat of being stuck. Curiosity landed in Gale Crater which
            also has a tall mountain in the middle of its existence. This
            mountain had many layers of rock and each layer had different
            minerals from a different time period which tells NASA about the
            possibility that the Red Planet had water at one point. <br>

    <p>In the list below we will display today's weather forecast so that we can see just how difficult it can be to
      achieve a successful launch. If any of these items fail the all-systems-go ready check,
      then any launches scheduled for the day would be postponed. However, if all of the weather checks come back green,
      then the mission would proceed as planned.</p>
